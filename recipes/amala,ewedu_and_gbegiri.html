    <p>
      Amala, ewedu, and gbegiri is a beloved Yoruba delicacy that brings
      together three distinct elements into one flavorful, hearty meal.
      <strong>Amala</strong> is a smooth, stretchy swallow made from yam flour
      (<em>elubo</em>) or plantain flour, cooked in hot water until it forms a
      soft, elastic dough. <strong> Ewedu</strong> is a green soup made from
      jute leaves, blended or whisked into a slippery, slightly mucilaginous
      texture, and flavored with locust beans (<em>iru</em>), seasoning, and
      sometimes ground crayfish. <strong>Gbegiri</strong>, on the other hand, is
      a silky, mild-tasting soup made from peeled beans, cooked until soft and
      then blended into a creamy, golden purée, often seasoned with palm oil and
      spices.
    </p>
    <p>
      When served together, these three components create a perfect harmony of
      flavors and textures. The mild, earthy taste of amala pairs beautifully
      with the light bitterness of ewedu and the gentle creaminess of gbegiri,
      all often topped with a rich, spicy stew and assorted meats. This
      combination is not just food—it's comfort and tradition on a plate, deeply
      rooted in Yoruba culture. Whether enjoyed at home, in a buka (local
      canteen), or during festive gatherings, amala with ewedu and gbegiri is a
      meal that satisfies both the stomach and the soul.

      </li>
      <li>Keep stirring until it becomes smooth, stretchy, and well-cooked.</li>
      <li>
        If it's too thick, add a little hot water, cover for a minute, then stir

      <li>Wrap in nylon or serve hot immediately.</li>
      <li>Wash the ewedu leaves thoroughly and remove the stalks.</li>
      <li>

        baking soda for softness).
      </li>
      <li>Add the leaves and cook for 3-5 minutes until soft.</li>
      <li>
        Blend or whisk the leaves using a traditional broom whisk
        (<em>ijabe</em>) or blender until smooth and slightly slimy.

        Blend into a smooth paste (you can blend with some of the cooking
        water).
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the paste back into the pot and add palm oil, ground crayfish
        (optional), pepper, seasoning cube, and salt.
      </li>

      <li>Simmer on low heat until the oil blends in and the soup thickens.</li>
