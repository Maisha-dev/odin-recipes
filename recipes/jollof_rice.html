    <p>
      Jollof rice is a vibrant and flavorful West African dish made with
      long-grain parboiled rice cooked in a rich tomato-based sauce. Its core
      ingredients typically include tomatoes, red bell peppers, onions, garlic,
      and a blend of spices like thyme, curry powder, and bay leaves. The dish
      is simmered until the rice absorbs the deeply spiced sauce, creating a
      one-pot meal that is smoky, slightly sweet, and savory. Depending on the
      region or personal preference, it can be made with vegetables, chicken,
      beef, fish, or left plain.

      Jollof rice is more than just food—it's a cultural icon and a symbol of
      pride across West Africa, especially in Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal, each
      claiming to make the best version. It is often the centerpiece at parties,
      weddings, and festive gatherings, served with fried plantains, salads, or
      grilled meats. While its origins are traced back to the Senegambian
      region, Jollof rice has evolved into a beloved and fiercely debated dish,
      with each country adding its unique twist. Its bold flavor, color, and
      aroma make it an unforgettable experience in African cuisine.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Blend the following until smooth: Fresh tomatoes Red bell peppers Onions
        Garlic and ginger.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the blended mixture into a pot and boil it (uncovered) until most
        of the water evaporates and it becomes a thick paste. This prevents
        soggy rice later.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, heat vegetable oil and sauté chopped onions until
        fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add tomato paste and fry it for a few minutes to reduce its sourness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the blended tomato mixture and cook on medium heat, stirring
        occasionally, until it thickens and the oil begins to separate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with: Salt Thyme Curry powder Seasoning cubes or powder Bay
        leaves Paprika or chili powder (optional)
      </li>
      <li>Pour in chicken or beef stock (or water) and bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>Rinse the parboiled long-grain rice and add it to the sauce.</li>
      <li>
        Stir well so the rice is coated with the sauce. The liquid should just
        barely cover the rice.
      </li>
      <li>Cover the pot with foil or a tight lid to trap the steam.</li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low and let it cook slowly for about 25–35 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check occasionally (without stirring too often) to avoid burning. If
        needed, add a small amount of water or stock and continue steaming.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the rice is tender and the liquid is fully absorbed, fluff it
        gently with a fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        For extra flavor, you can stir in a knob of butter or mix in vegetables
        or protein.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve hot with fried plantains, salad, chicken, beef, or any preferred
        side.
      </li>
