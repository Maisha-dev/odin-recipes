    <h1>Pap and Akara</h1>

    <p>
      Pap and akara is a classic Nigerian breakfast combination that pairs a
      smooth, creamy corn porridge with golden, crispy bean cakes.
      <strong>Pap</strong>—also called <em> ogi</em>—is made from fermented
      maize and cooked into a thick, custard-like consistency, often sweetened
      with sugar and enriched with milk. It has a slightly tangy flavor from the
      fermentation process and is enjoyed hot, making it both soothing and
      filling. <strong> Akara</strong>, on the other hand, are deep-fried
      fritters made from peeled black-eyed beans blended with onions, peppers,
      and seasoning. The mixture is fried until the outside is crisp while the
      inside stays soft and fluffy.

      Together, pap and akara create a comforting balance of textures and
      flavors: the warm, silky pap contrasts perfectly with the crunchy, savory
      akara. This duo is not only popular for breakfast but also enjoyed as a
      light evening meal or street food snack across Nigeria and West Africa.
      Beyond its taste, it's a meal that carries cultural nostalgia—often
      associated with family mornings, bustling roadside stalls, and traditional
      weekend treats. It's simple, hearty, and deeply rooted in everyday
      Nigerian life.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fermented maize (corn) paste or powder</li>
      <li>Water (for mixing and cooking)</li>
      <li>Sugar or honey (optional, for sweetness)</li>
      <li>Milk (powdered, evaporated, or fresh — optional)</li>
      <li>Black-eyed beans (peeled)</li>
      <li>Onions (chopped)</li>

      <li>Fresh pepper (scotch bonnet or chili)</li>
      <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
      <li>Seasoning cube or powder (optional)</li>
      <li>Water (for blending)</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the fermented maize paste (or powder) in a bowl. Add a little
        water and stir until it forms a smooth, lump-free mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat clean water in a kettle or pot until it reaches boiling point.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually pour the boiling water into the pap mixture while stirring
        continuously. Keep stirring until the pap thickens to your desired
        consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Soak black-eyed beans in water for a few minutes. Rub between your palms
        or blend briefly to remove the skins, then rinse until the skins are
        gone.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a blender, combine the peeled beans, chopped onions, and fresh
        peppers. Add just enough water to blend into a thick, smooth paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the paste into a bowl, add salt and seasoning cube/powder
        (optional), and mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan. Scoop spoonfuls of the mixture into
        the hot oil, frying in batches. Fry until golden brown on all sides,
        then remove and drain on paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sugar or honey (optional) and milk to the pap for extra creaminess.
        Serve hot, alongside akara.
      </li>
    </ol>
